## Implementation Details

### 1. Advanced Job Filtering

**File**: `app/components/features/advanced-job-filters.tsx` (289 lines)

#### Features Implemented

- **Text Search**: Search by job ID or document ID with real-time filtering
- **Status Filter**: Quick status buttons (all, pending, in progress, completed, failed, partial, cancelled)
- **Channel Filter**: Multi-select channel filtering (email, website, social media)
- **Date Range Filter**: Filter jobs by creation date range
- **Expandable UI**: Collapsible advanced filters to save screen space
- **Active Filter Indicators**: Visual badges showing active filters
- **Filter Summary**: Shows all active filters in a summary panel

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Expandable Filter Panel**: Basic filters (search, status) always visible, advanced filters (channels, dates) expandable
   ```typescript
   const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState<boolean>(false);
   ```

2. **Filter State Management**: Centralized filter state with typed interface
   ```typescript
   export interface JobFilterState {
     search: string;
     status: JobStatus | 'all';
     channels: Channel[];
     dateRange: {
       from: string;
       to: string;
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Active Filter Badges**: Visual indication of applied filters
   ```typescript
   const hasActiveFilters =
     filters.search !== '' ||
     filters.status !== 'all' ||
     filters.channels.length > 0 ||
     filters.dateRange.from !== '' ||
     filters.dateRange.to !== '';
   ```

#### Technical Implementation

**Filter Application in JobsList**:
```typescript
const applyFilters = useCallback(
  (jobsList: SyncJob[]): SyncJob[] => {
    if (!filters) return jobsList;

    return jobsList.filter(job => {
      // Search filter
      if (filters.search) {
        const searchLower = filters.search.toLowerCase();
        const matchesJobId = job.job_id.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower);
        const matchesDocId = job.document_id.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower);
        if (!matchesJobId && !matchesDocId) return false;
      }

      // Channel filter
      if (filters.channels.length > 0) {
        const hasMatchingChannel = filters.channels.some(channel =>
          job.channels.includes(channel)
        );
        if (!hasMatchingChannel) return false;
      }

      // Date range filter
      if (filters.dateRange.from || filters.dateRange.to) {
        const jobDate = new Date(job.created_at).getTime();
        // ... date comparison logic
      }

      return true;
    });
  },
  [filters]
);
```

### 2. Batch Operations UI

**File**: `app/components/features/batch-job-operations.tsx` (172 lines)

#### Features Implemented

- **Multi-Select**: Checkbox on each job for batch selection
- **Batch Retry**: Retry multiple failed jobs simultaneously
- **Batch Cancel**: Cancel multiple active jobs simultaneously
- **Batch Export**: Export selected jobs to CSV
- **Fixed Toolbar**: Sticky bottom toolbar appears when jobs selected
- **Smart Actions**: Actions enabled/disabled based on job states
- **Selection Count**: Shows number of selected jobs and their states

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Fixed Bottom Toolbar**: Always visible when selections exist, doesn't block content
   ```typescript
   <div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-t-2 border-blue-500 shadow-2xl z-40">
   ```

2. **Smart Action Buttons**: Show only applicable actions
   ```typescript
   const retryableJobs = selectedJobs.filter(job => job.status === 'failed');
   const cancellableJobs = selectedJobs.filter(
     job => job.status === 'pending' || job.status === 'in_progress'
   );
   ```

3. **Selection State Management**: Centralized in parent component
   ```typescript
   const [selectedJobs, setSelectedJobs] = useState<SyncJob[]>([]);

   const handleToggleJobSelection = useCallback((job: SyncJob): void => {
     setSelectedJobs(prev => {
       const isSelected = prev.some(j => j.job_id === job.job_id);
       if (isSelected) {
         return prev.filter(j => j.job_id !== job.job_id);
       } else {
         return [...prev, job];
       }
     });
   }, []);
   ```

#### Technical Implementation

**Batch Retry with Promise.allSettled**:
```typescript
const handleBatchRetry = useCallback(
  async (jobIds: string[]): Promise<void> => {
    toast.info(`Retrying ${jobIds.length} jobs...`);

    const { ContentGeneratorAPI } = await import('@/lib/api/api-client');
    const api = new ContentGeneratorAPI(API_URL, apiKey);

    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
      jobIds.map(jobId => api.retryJob(jobId))
    );

    const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length;
    const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected').length;

    if (successful > 0) {
      toast.success(`Successfully retried ${successful} jobs`);
      setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1);
    }

    if (failed > 0) {
      toast.warning(`Failed to retry ${failed} jobs`);
    }

    setSelectedJobs([]);
  },
  [apiKey, API_URL, toast]
);
```

**Checkbox Integration in JobsList**:
```typescript
{onToggleSelection && (
  <div className="flex items-center mr-3">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={isSelected}
      onChange={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        onToggleSelection(job);
      }}
      className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-600 border-gray-300 rounded focus:ring-blue-500"
    />
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Export Functionality

**Implementation**: Integrated into batch operations

#### Features Implemented

- **CSV Export**: Export job data to CSV format
- **Timestamped Files**: Automatic filename with timestamp
- **Comprehensive Data**: Exports all relevant job fields
- **Browser Download**: Uses Blob API for client-side download
- **User Feedback**: Toast notification on successful export

#### Technical Implementation

**CSV Generation**:
```typescript
const handleBatchExport = useCallback(
  (jobs: SyncJob[]): void => {
    // CSV export
    const csvHeaders = ['Job ID', 'Document ID', 'Status', 'Channels', 'Created At', 'Completed At'];
    const csvRows = jobs.map(job => [
      job.job_id,
      job.document_id,
      job.status,
      job.channels.join('; '),
      job.created_at,
      job.completed_at || 'N/A',
    ]);

    const csvContent = [
      csvHeaders.join(','),
      ...csvRows.map(row => row.map(cell => `"${cell}"`).join(','))
    ].join('\n');

    const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;' });
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    link.setAttribute('href', url);
    link.setAttribute('download', `jobs_export_${new Date().toISOString()}.csv`);
    link.style.visibility = 'hidden';
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    document.body.removeChild(link);

    toast.success(`Exported ${jobs.length} jobs to CSV`);
    setSelectedJobs([]);
  },
  [toast]
);
```

**CSV Format Example**:
```csv
"Job ID","Document ID","Status","Channels","Created At","Completed At"
"job-123-abc","gdocs:456","completed","email; website","2025-10-02T10:30:00Z","2025-10-02T10:35:00Z"
"job-789-xyz","notion:def","failed","social_twitter","2025-10-02T11:00:00Z","N/A"
```

## Type Safety Enhancements

### Updated Types

**types/content-generator.ts**:

1. **JobFilterState** - New interface for filter state
   ```typescript
   export interface JobFilterState {
     search: string;
     status: JobStatus | 'all';
     channels: Channel[];
     dateRange: {
       from: string;
       to: string;
     };
   }
   ```

2. **JobsListProps** - Enhanced with filter and selection support
   ```typescript
   export interface JobsListProps {
     apiUrl: string;
     apiKey?: string;
     refreshInterval?: number;
     pageSize?: number;
     statusFilter?: JobStatus[];
     onJobClick?: (job: SyncJob) => void;
     refreshTrigger?: number;
     filters?: JobFilterState;
     selectedJobs?: SyncJob[];
     onToggleSelection?: (job: SyncJob) => void;
   }
   ```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Client-Side vs Server-Side Filtering

**Decision**: Hybrid approach - status filtering on server, advanced filtering on client

**Rationale**:
- Server-side status filtering reduces initial data transfer
- Client-side search/channel/date filtering provides instant results
- Best of both worlds for performance and UX

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Server-side: Status filter
const statusToUse = filters?.status || selectedStatus;
if (statusToUse !== 'all') {
  params.status = statusToUse;
}

// Client-side: Apply additional filters
const filteredJobs = applyFilters(response.data.jobs);
```

### 2. Batch Operations Error Handling

**Decision**: Use Promise.allSettled with granular success/failure reporting

**Rationale**:
- Some jobs may succeed while others fail
- User needs to know partial success status
- Better than all-or-nothing approach

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const results = await Promise.allSettled(
  jobIds.map(jobId => api.retryJob(jobId))
);

const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length;
const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected').length;
```

### 3. Fixed Bottom Toolbar Pattern

**Decision**: Fixed position toolbar that appears on selection

**Rationale**:
- Always accessible when needed
- Doesn't interfere with scrolling
- Clear visual separation from content
- Industry-standard pattern (Gmail, Google Drive, etc.)

- ✅ Checkbox selection with visual highlighting
- ✅ Smart action buttons (only show applicable actions)
- ✅ Selection count with job state breakdown
- ✅ Clear selection button
- ✅ Progress indicators via toast notifications
- ✅ Auto-clear selection after action

### 3. Export UX

- ✅ One-click CSV export
- ✅ Timestamped filenames (no overwrite confusion)
- ✅ Comprehensive data export
- ✅ Success feedback via toast
- ✅ Automatic file download

## Sprint 6 Features Not Implemented

Due to time and complexity constraints, the following features from the original Sprint 6 plan were not implemented:

### Analytics Dashboard Page
- **Reason**: Requires significant data aggregation and charting library integration
- **Future Work**: Sprint 7 can focus on analytics and visualization
- **Recommendation**: Use Recharts library for charts, create analytics API endpoints

### User Preferences Persistence
- **Reason**: Already have some persistence (API key in localStorage via Sprint 5)
- **Future Work**: Expand to filter preferences, column preferences, etc.
- **Recommendation**: Create preferences context similar to auth context

### Content History View
- **Reason**: Requires new backend endpoints for historical data
- **Future Work**: Create dedicated history page with timeline view
- **Recommendation**: Add filtering by date, user, content type
