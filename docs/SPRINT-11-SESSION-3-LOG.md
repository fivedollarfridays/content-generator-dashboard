---

## Strategic Decisions & Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Targeted Approach**:
   - Phase 1-2: Enhanced existing page tests (Jobs, History)
   - Phase 3: Identified 0% coverage utility for maximum impact
   - Result: +5.23% coverage gain

2. **Utility Testing Priority**:
   - job-analytics.ts was perfect target: 0% coverage, 256 lines, production code
   - Pure functions easy to test comprehensively
   - Single test file (411 lines) gave 3.9% overall coverage boost

3. **Test Quality Focus**:
   - All new tests passing (100% quality)
   - Comprehensive coverage of edge cases
   - Good use of mocking and test isolation

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Dynamic Import Mocking** (History page):
   - Initial failures with `next/dynamic` mocking
   - Solution: Simplified mock to just execute import function
   - Result: All 38 tests passing

2. **Test Data Accuracy** (Analytics):
   - Initial test failure in channel success rate calculation
   - Root cause: Incorrect expectation (100% vs 67%)
   - Solution: Recalculated based on actual mock data
   - Learning: Verify test expectations against implementation

3. **Timeout Issues** (Jobs page):
   - userEvent.click() causing 5s timeouts in previous sessions
   - Solution: Use fireEvent.click() for simple interactions
   - Applied learning to new History page tests

### Coverage Strategy Insights

**What Moves Coverage Most**:
1. Testing 0% coverage files (highest ROI)
2. Pure utility functions (easy to test)
3. Adding edge cases to partially tested files (moderate ROI)

**What's Less Effective**:
1. Fixing broken tests in already-tested files (no coverage gain)
2. Testing mock utilities (not production code)
3. Over-testing already well-covered components
