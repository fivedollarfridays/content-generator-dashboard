## 🎯 Context Loop (Update After Every Change)

### Overall goal is:

Build a production-ready dashboard for the Content Generator product that provides an intuitive, accessible interface for content creation and management.

### Last action was:

**Sprint 10 Session 14: Analytics & Error-Boundary Test Fixes** ✅ (In Progress):

**Sprint 10 Session 12: Test Fixes & Pass Rate Improvement** ✅ (Complete):
- **Pass Rate Progress**: 83.2% → 85.9% (+2.7 percentage points)
- **Passing Tests**: 653 → 670 (+17 tests)
- **Total Tests**: 785 → 780 (streamlined Analytics tests)
- **Coverage**: 59.13% → 57.56% (-1.57%, Analytics test restructuring impact)

**Analytics Page Tests** (Partial Fix):
- **Approach**: Complete rewrite to use mock-data-generator (was incorrectly using API client mocks)
- **Failures**: 21 → 10 (11 tests fixed)
- **Coverage**: ~90% → 97.5% ✅
- **Passing**: 17/38 → 23/33 (70% pass rate)
- **Remaining**: 10 failures in metric display assertions

**Jobs Page Tests** (Complete Fix):
- **Failures**: 11 → 0 ✅ (100% passing, 34/34 tests)
- **Coverage**: 39.15% → 53.61% (+14.46%)
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Modal backdrop click: Fixed element selector
  - Export CSV/JSON: Added proper blob/URL mocking without breaking render
  - Environment tests: All passing after export mock cleanup
  - Accessibility: Fixed link text matcher (+ Generate New Content)

**Key Achievements**:
- Jobs page tests now 100% passing (all 34 tests ✅)
- Test pass rate improved significantly: 83.2% → 85.9%
- Jobs page coverage jumped: 39.15% → 53.61%
- Analytics page coverage excellent: 97.5%
- Cumulative Sprint 10 progress: 33.36% (start) → 57.56% (current)

**Coverage Note**:
- Coverage decreased slightly (59.13% → 57.56%) due to Analytics test restructuring
- However, code is now tested more correctly with proper mocking strategy
- Test quality improved (pass rate up, failures down)

**Session 14 Summary**:
- **Total Tests Fixed**: 15 (10 Analytics + 4 Error-Boundary + 1 Job-Status-Card)
- **Pass Rate**: 85.9% → 88.5% (+2.6%)
- **Passing Tests**: 670 → 729 (+59)
- **Failures**: 108 → 93 (-15)
- **Coverage**: 58.98% (unchanged - need +11.02% to reach 70%)

**Coverage Gap Analysis**:
- Statements: 58.98% → Need 70% (+11.02%)
- Branches: 51.54% → Need 70% (+18.46%)
- Functions: 62.38% → Need 70% (+7.62%)
- Lines: 60.11% → Need 70% (+9.89%)

**Key Finding**: Test quality improved significantly (pass rate 88.5%), but coverage didn't increase because:
- Fixed tests were for already-covered components
- Need to test 0% coverage components OR fix more page-level tests
- Biggest gap is in branch coverage (18.46%)

**Commits**:
1. c78caa8 - fix: Fix all 10 Analytics page test failures
2. 5411744 - fix: Fix all 4 error-boundary test failures
3. 0c8f902 - docs: Update development.md with Session 14 progress
4. 4e309b4 - fix: Fix job-status-card test (correlation_id display)

### Next action will be:

**Sprint 10 Session 15 - Final Coverage Push to 70%** (4-6 hours estimated):

**Current Status**: 58.98% coverage, need +11.02% to reach 70%

**Strategy Decision Required**:

**Option A: Test High-Value 0% Components** (~8-12% coverage gain potential):
1. job-timeline.tsx (335 lines, 0%) - Estimated +1.5%
2. template-selector.tsx (354 lines, 0%) - Estimated +1.5%
3. content-generator-health.tsx (284 lines, 0%) - Estimated +1%
4. Advanced filters/forms (various) - Estimated +3-4%
5. **Benefit**: Direct coverage gains, tests new code
6. **Risk**: Complex components may have testing challenges

**Option B: Fix Remaining Page Test Failures** (~4-8% coverage gain):
1. Fix remaining 93 test failures across pages
2. Dashboard, Generate, Settings, History, Templates pages
3. Auth-context (16 failures), Jobs-list (6 failures)
4. **Benefit**: Improves test quality, may uncover bugs
5. **Risk**: Slower coverage gains, may hit difficult edge cases

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid
1. Start with Option B quick wins (simple async timing fixes)
2. Pivot to Option A if page tests prove too complex
3. Target: 68-72% coverage range

**See**: `docs/SPRINT-10-COVERAGE-PLAN.md` for complete strategy

### Blockers/Risks:

**Test Coverage Gap**: 58.98% vs 70% DoD Target (Medium Risk 🟡)

- **Current Status**: 58.98% (Session 14 complete)
- **Remaining Gap**: 11.02 percentage points to reach 70%
- **Sprint 10 Progress**: Sessions 7-14 achieved +25.62 percentage points (from 33.36% start)
- **Session 14 Impact**: Test quality significantly improved (88.5% pass rate), but coverage unchanged
- **Test Quality**: Pass rate 88.5% (729/824), failures down to 93 (from 108)
- **Well-Covered**: Analytics page (97.5%), Job-status-card (94%), Error-boundary (94%), Timeline (96%), Filters (95%), Job-charts (93%), Analytics-metrics (90%), Batch-operations (87%)
- **Moderate**: Jobs page (54%), Settings (43%)
- **Needs Work**: Many 0% components (job-timeline, template-selector, content-generator-health, cache-stats)
- **Biggest Gap**: Branch coverage at 51.54% (need +18.46%)
- **Path Forward**: Must test 0% components OR fix 30-40 more page tests
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium - requires focused effort on untested components

**None** - No significant blockers, clear path forward
